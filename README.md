## ⚠️ Notes

- The chat widget uses mocked responses due to the absence of a real LLM API key.
- A favicon placeholder is referenced as `src/assets/favicon.ico`; replace it with your actual logo for production.
- The site is optimized for Vercel/Netlify deployment with Vite's default configuration.
